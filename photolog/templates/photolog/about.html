    I am a french student, interested in computer stuff and oddities. On this matter,
    I deeply support open source based projects. From linux distros to basic softwares,
    it should be a major concern as many people fail to see what's going on beyond their screens,
    despite massively leaking personnal data.
    
    <p> Plenty of cool free stuff here :

    This is also the guarantee to have no "black box", eg. you can learn, understand and
    improve things you use every day, instead of enduring them. By the way, source code of
    this site is availabe on this repo : 
    <p> <a href="https://bitbucket.org/florentin_vallee/travel21"> https://bitbucket.org/florentin_vallee/travel21 </a>
    <p>Feel free to send me any advice to improve this code !
